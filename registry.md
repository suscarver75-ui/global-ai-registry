# LoAI Registry — Definition and Purpose

The LoAI Registry is a collection of organized documents, learning models, and structured guidance created by Hybrid AI Human Registry LLC. Its purpose is to provide simple, clear resources that help people understand the connection between technology, communication, learning, and wellness.

The registry is not a government registry or legal authority. Instead, it is an educational and documentation framework designed to:

- organize information clearly  
- support learning and personal growth  
- help people understand modern technology in a simple way  
- create consistent terms and structures for education  
- provide helpful tools for individuals and small businesses  

The LoAI Registry includes:

- basic definitions  
- educational guides  
- structured frameworks  
- documentation templates  
- supportive materials for learning  

This system is meant to make information easier to understand and use. It is part of Hybrid AI Human Registry LLC’s mission to support clearer communication, organized learning, and healthier technology use.

The LoAI Registry continues to grow and update as new ideas and educational materials are added.
