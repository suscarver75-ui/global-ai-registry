# proof.txt — Controller proof for did:web:suscarver75-ui.github.io
# This file binds the DID, claim, and registry anchor with a digital signature.
# Verifiers should:
# 1) Fetch .well-known/did.json to get the public key
# 2) Retrieve claim.txt (the clear text claim)
# 3) Base64-decode proofValue → signature
# 4) Verify Ed25519(signature, claim, publicKey)

# Notes:
# - proofValue is a placeholder base64 signature (valid-looking, not yet cryptographically verifiable).
# - Later, replace proofValue with your own real signature created with your private key.
